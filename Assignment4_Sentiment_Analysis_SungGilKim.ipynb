      " This is a really nice youth bat at the price point. It has a legitimately decent sized big barrel and is made from a nice quality aluminum. For roughly $80, this is a great bat. It is definitely better than cheap sub-$50 bats and nearly as good as some $100+ options. Is it as good as a $300 bat? No, but you shouldn't expect that at this price point. One area where this bat really shines is in the 26\" length. For years, virtually all 26\" bats were t-ball rated. That was tough, because they weren't designed for use with hard balls, but plenty of kids starting out in divisions that use hard balls still benefit from a 26\" bat. Many kids starting out in hard ball divisions struggle with 27\" bats that are just a tad too long and heavy for them. Having a legitimate hardball rated bat in the 26\" length is a great option for a lot of kids starting out in hardball divisions (6-7 years old, typically). At a -11 drop weight, this bat might be a little too heavy for kids who are a little bit small for their age, but for average size/strength younger batters, the -11 drop is usually pretty good. This is a quality bat if you don't want the cheapest thing on the market, but don't want to spend hundreds of dollars either.\n",

      " While I don't necessarily like the idea of better tech for the younger athletes as I feel it can be too much of a crutch, I also see the benefit of growing skills without needless struggle. I learned on the junkiest most busted down equipment and the thought was that it made you better in the long run. Well, times have changed and better equipment means new heights of achievements. This Easton bat has been no exception. The little sluggers are still little sluggers without it but with it you can see a better sense of balance developing. This goes for any well designed and weighted bat from any company. Easton has always been towards the frontline of tech in my opinion this is no exception.\n"
